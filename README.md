# **Diabetes Prediction Web Application**
# Overview :
A web application to determine whether a person has diabetes or not, using the XG Boost model to predict the diabetes outcome when the following data is entered: glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, body mass index (BMI), diabetes pedigree function, age.

# Project advantages :
* User interface: A simple interface for easy input of health data.
* XGBoost model: The XGBoost model, known for its high accuracy in predictions, is used.
* Instant prediction: Provides instant prediction results based on user inputs.

# Technologies Used :
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
* Backend: Python, Flask.
* Machine learning: logistic regression, KNN, SVM, random forest, decision tree, XGBoost, and XGBoost was chosen as the best model in terms of precision, recall, and, ROC-AUC for predicting diabetes outcomes in a web application.
